`mytonctrl_bot` - This bot allows you to monitor the state of the validator.
To start using the bot, add the validator address to the watch list.
ADNL address and Fullnode ADNL address you should take from the MyTonCtrl status

```
/status - Show the status of the validators you are subscribed to
/add_adnl - Add ADNL address to subscriptions
/add_fullnode_adnl - Add fullnode ADNL address to access its telemetry
/remove_adnl - Remove ADNL from subscriptions
/adnl_list - Show list of subscriptions
/add_alert - Add warning check to your validators
/remove_alert - Remove warning check to your validators
/alert_list - Show list of active warnings
```


**Example**:
Add ADNL address to subscriptions. Instead of the full address of the validator, you can use the last few characters:
`/add_adnl 4F59`

Add a Fullnode ADNL to display node telemetry. Without telemetry `TelemetryAlert` will not work:
`/add_fullnode_adnl 184FE843EE98F1C43087BFDB5F948A684AAC5BF1D2031308A6F5DA34174C615A`

Now we can see the status of our added validator. There can be several validators:
`/status`

We will also add alarms if a complaint has been created against us:
`/add_alert ComplaintsAlert`
